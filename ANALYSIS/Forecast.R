# Forecasting models with smoothing and related approaches
# Exponential Smoothing uses past values to calculate a forecast. The strength with which each value influences the forecast is weakened with help of a smoothing parameter. Thus we are dealing with a weighted average, whose values fade out the longer ago they were in the past.

# The Akaike's Information Criterion(AIC/AICc) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) should be at minimum.

## Simple expontential smoothing

## Holt's linear trend method   
# Holt added to the model in order to forecast using trends as well. For this it is necessary to add a beta, which determines the trend. If neither alpha nor beta is stated, both parameters will be optimised using ets(). The trend is exponential if the intercepts(level) and the gradient (slope) are multiplied with eachother. The values are worse. As the Beta was very low in the optimisation, the forecast is very similar to the ses() model. 

Model_holt_1 <- holt(BlueEtelAsIs,h=12)
plot(Model_holt_1)

# expoential trend
Model_holt_2<- holt(BlueEtelAsIs, exponential=TRUE,h=12)
plot(Model_holt_2)

## Dampened trends
# As such simple trends tend to forecast the future to positively, we have added a dampener. This also works for exponential trends. We also plot the level and slope individually for each model.

## Holt-Winter's seasonal method   
# Holt and Winters have expanded Holt's model further to include the seasonality aspect. The parameter gamma, which is for smoothing the seasonality, was added to achieve this. The values are better than the models without seasonality. This is logical, since the data is strongly influenced by seasonality.  In the following model, none of the parameters are given so that they will be optimised automatically. There are two models: one using an additive error model method and one using a multiplicative error model. The additive model gives slightly better results than the multiplicative model.

Model_hw_1 <- hw(BlueEtelAsIs ,seasonal="additive",h=12)
plot(Model_hw_1)

Model_hw_2 <- hw(BlueEtelAsIs ,seasonal="multiplicative",h=12)

# The additive holt winters looks like the best model

# In order to use the results later, they need to be converted into point forecasts.
